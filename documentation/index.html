	<h1>Evothings Studio</h1>

	<p>Evothings Studio is a set of development tools, designed for development of mobile apps using web technologies. Evothings Studio is specifically designed for development of apps for the Internet of Things.</p>

	<p><b>Evothings Studio consists of:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="studio/workbench.html">Evothings Workbench</a> - Desktop IDE that supports fast turn around development and live editing of apps running on mobile devices.</li>
		<li><a href="studio/mobile-app.html">Evothings Client</a> - Mobile application for running IoT apps written in HTML/JavaScript. Connect from any number of mobile devices running the Evothings Client to the Workbench and enjoy simultaneous live reload.</li>
		<li><a href="examples/examples.html">Example Apps</a> - Collection of example apps to get started quickly and get inspiration for making IoT apps.</li>
		<li><a href="studio/mobile-app.html#SupportedPlugins">Native Plugins</a> - Plugins implemented in the Cordova framework that provide native IoT functionality from JavaScript.</li>
		<li><b>Universal Editor/IDE support</b> - Use any text editor or programming IDE to code with instant-reload-on-save. Also works with graphics editors. Just press save to reload changes on connected mobile devices.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>With Evothings Workbench you can take advantage of HTML5 technologies and JavaScript to develop mobile web apps and hybrid apps - with very fast turn-around time. Use any text editor or graphical editor to author HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Every time you save, the app is instantly reloaded, and you can directly see the result. This also works with image editors.</p>

	<p>The Evothings mobile app is a native application that you run on your mobile devices. It connects to Evothings Studio to enable live editing of your HTML/CSS/JavaScript code. The app contains native functionality that is accessible from JavaScript, such as Bluetooth Low Energy.</p>

<div id="QuickStart" class="evo-box">
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>

	<p><b>Very quick version:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Download and run the Evothings Workbench application on your computer.</li>
		<li>Install and run the Evothings Client app on your mobile device.</li>
		<li>Connect from Evothings Client to the Workbench.</li>
		<li>Click the "Run" button of the "Hello World" example.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><b>Slightly longer version:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Download and run the Evothings Workbench application on your computer.</li>
		<li>Download and install the Evothings Client app on your mobile device.</li>
		<li>Launch the app and select "Scan". Select your computer running Evothings Workbench from the list.</li>
		<li>Alternatively, enter the URL shown in the bottom panel of the Workbench and click "Connect".</li>
		<li>The app should now connect to Evothings Studio and display the message "Connected".</li>
		<li>Click the "Run" button of one of the apps in Evothings Workbench. Does the mobile display the app you selected? If so, you are up and running!</li>
		<li>You can connect any number of mobile devices, and instantly see the result on each of them!</li>
		<li><b>Mobile devices must be on the same local WiFi network as the computer running Evothings Workbench to be able connect using the "Scan" method.</b> If your computer has a public IP address, you can connect devices from anywhere on the Internet!</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div id="DeployingApps" class="evo-box">
	<h2>Deploying Your Apps</h2>
	<p>To deploy your final app developed with Evothings Studio on an app store, you build your app with Apache Cordova. Read more in the guide <a href="build/build-overview.html">How To Build Native Apps</a>.</p>
	<p>The quickest and easiest way to share your app with others, is putting your app on a web server, asking your users to download Evothings Client and enter the URL to your app. Find out the details in the guide <a href="build/share-apps.html">Share Your App</a>.</p>

	<h2>Release Notes</h2>

	<ul>

	</ul>

	<p><b>Evothings Client:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Supported platforms for the Evothings Client app are Android and iOS.</li>
		<li>Plugin for Estimote Beacons has been added. Special credits to <a href="https://github.com/kdzwinel">Konrad Dzwinel</a> who is the original creator of this plugin.</li>
		<li>Local notification plugin added (can be used for background notifications).</li>
	</ul>

	<p><b>Example apps:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>New example app for Estimote Beacons.</li>
		<li>Two new example apps for RedBearLabs.</li>
		<li>New example app for LightBlue Bean.</li>
		<li>New example app for Nordic Eval Kit.</li>
		<li>New example app for RFduino.</li>
		<li>New example app for DFRobot Bluno.</li>
		<li>Updated TISensorTag example apps.</li>
		<li>Updated iBeacon Scan app to use the new API of the Cordova iBeacon plugin.</li>
		<li>In BLE Scan, display of device.address has been removed on iOS, this is a UUID that can be mistaken for an iBeacon UUID (which it is not, it is just a temporary UUID assigned by iOS).</li>
	</ul>

	<p><b>Libraries:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Updated TISensorTag library (support for accessing firmware version, calculation of sensor values etc).</li>
		<li>New library file <a href="https://github.com/evothings/evothings-examples/blob/master/resources/libs/evothings/evothings.js">evothings.js</a>, which must be included in all apps that use Evothings library functions. Supports asynchronous loading of JavaScript libraries, using the evothings.loadScript function. Use function evothings.scriptsLoaded(doneCallback) to ensure all script have been loaded, or pass a callback to evothings.loadScript to know when a single script has loaded. These callbacks take no parameters.</li>
		<li>New JavaScript library evothings.util with support for number conversions etc.
		<li>The cordova-ble plugin has support for accessing advertisement data using the easyble.js library.</li>
		<li>easyble.js asynchronously loads util.js. To be safe, use evothings.scriptsLoaded(doneCallback) to ensure all scripts are loaded before using functions in easyble.js. Example TI SensorTag Sensors uses this method, see code at the end of <a href="https://github.com/evothings/evothings-examples/blob/master/examples/ti-sensortag-sensors/index.html">index.html</a>.</li>

		<li>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is implemented in the Evothings client app, but please note that BLE on Android is not always stable. Unfortunately this affects Evothings Workbench in that it may not work to reload apps that use BLE. A workaround is to restart the Evothings client app if BLE should stop working.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Good To Know</h2>
	<p>For apps that do not require native device functionality, any modern browser (desktop or mobile) can be used as a client with Evothings Workbench. When connecting using a browser, use the URL displayed in the bottom panel of the Workbench window (don't omit the port number).</p>
	<p>You are encouraged to explore the "Tools" window tab in the Workbench. This window displays output from the hyper.log() function, and lets you evaluate JavaScript code interactively on connected devices. This is very useful for debugging purposes, for trying out code snippets and inspecting the value of variables.</p>
	<p>Evothings Workbench contains a Feedback button, please let us know what you think.</p>
	<p>Bugs and feature requests can be reported using the GitHub issue tracker, see links to repositories below under the "Source Code" section.</p>
